# PostgreSQL Database Connection String
# Format: postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
# Example for local development: postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/entipedia
# Example for production: Use your PostgreSQL provider's connection string
# This file should be copied to .env for local development and never committed to version control.
# For production (e.g., Netlify), configure this variable in the deployment environment.
# Append `?ssl=true` when your provider mandates TLS (postgres.js also accepts `?sslmode=require`).
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/entipedia

# Session Secret for H3 useSession encryption
# Generate a strong random secret (minimum 32 characters)
# Use: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
# IMPORTANT: Keep this secret secure and never commit the actual .env file
# Set this in your hosting provider (e.g., Netlify) for production deployments
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-min-32-chars

# Development Server Configuration
# These variables control the standalone Nitro development server used by `npm run dev:server`.
# The frontend continues to run on http://localhost:5000 while the backend listens on the port below.
# Uncomment and adjust as needed for your environment.
# NITRO_PORT=5999
# NITRO_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Railway.app Deployment Configuration
# Railway assigns PORT dynamically at runtime; override locally if you need to mirror their behavior.
# PORT=3000
# Set NODE_ENV=production when deploying to Railway. It defaults to development when unspecified.
# NODE_ENV=production
# Ensure DATABASE_URL and SESSION_SECRET are defined in the Railway environment variables dashboard.
# The managed PostgreSQL add-on provisions DATABASE_URL automatically; provide SESSION_SECRET manually using the command above.
# Refer to doc/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md for the full deployment walkthrough once available.
